    <h1>Now</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      A snapshot of what I’m currently spending time and attention on.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>
      I’m learning machine learning, 
      mainly using <em>Machine Learning for Physicists</em>.
      I’m following along with the accompanying lectures and working through examples.

    </p>

    <p>
      Separately, I’m learning Lua through <a href="https://www.codedex.io" target="_blank">CodeDex</a>,
      mostly as a low-friction way to keep coding regularly.
    </p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
      I’m working on a semester-long astronomy project studying how H&nbsp;I shells 
      and holes in galaxies may influence star formation.
      This involves analyzing observational data and connecting it with physical intuition.
    </p>

    <h2>Life</h2>
    <p>
      Trying to keep things simple: showing up to work most days, 
      taking walks, drinking too much coffee, and figuring things out slowly.
