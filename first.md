# First Thoughts

I have been meaning to start a blog for a while now, but didn't for a variety of reasons. I thought I didn't have anything interesting to say, that I didn't have time to maintain a blog. Also, I didn't want to use WordPress like I did back in the day. I wanted something that gave a little bit more control, even though I know next to nothing about HTML, CSS or other things that are required to host a blog. But, I found GitHub Pages, and it sort of ticked all the boxes for me. I get a nice domain, and I get to write the pages on my site as markdown files. Although I spent about four hours trying to make a fancier looking site to no avail, I now have a pretty simple site that allows me to write whatever I want. The plan is to eventually learn how work with Jekyll and make a prettier website, but until then, this will do. 

I have a few things that I would like to write on this blog, which include but are not limited to: 
- thought dumps, kind of like a journal
- something interesting that read/learned about
- updates on what I have been learning
- compilations of resources I find helpful for learning a particular thing
- maybe book/movie reviews

The major reason I want to have a blog is to express myself without feeling like I am taking someone's valuable time involuntarily. There have been times where I have journaled pretty regularly and during those times I felt way better on a day to day basis. I am hoping to achieve that more regularly. And I just like writing. Especially since my girlfriend got me the keyboard I had wanted for so long (its Logitech's K380), I just love typing. It is so satisfying! I think it might be the best gift I have ever gotten. Anyways, I am going to stop here now, and I hope to write again very soon!
