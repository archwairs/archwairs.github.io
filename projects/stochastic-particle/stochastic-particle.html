  <h1>Stochastic particle with sign-dependent drift</h1>

  <p>
    This is an interactive visualization of a stochastic particle evolving under
    a deterministic drift proportional to <code>sign(x)</code> and additive thermal noise.
  </p>

  <p>
    The model was originally implemented in Python as part of a numerical study
    of stochastic dynamics, and later adapted to JavaScript for real-time visualization
    on the web.

  <p class="note">
    The simulation uses Euler–Maruyama integration and Gaussian noise.
