      <p>
        It has been so long since I last sat down and wrote something. I have been
        writing text messages to ChatGPT, as a way to ground myself, but that doesn’t
        really count as writing in my opinion.
      </p>

      <p>
        It has been about fifteen days since my new semester has started, and I am
        already starting to feel a little burnt out, even though the semester hasn’t
        demanded much apart from showing up to classes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before this, I was at home for a couple of weeks for my winter break. That was
        good rest. I didn’t do any formal work. I woke up late, had good food, hung out
        with my friends, and finished reading <em>Men Without Women</em> by Murakami.
        It was a good read, and it made me want to watch <em>Drive My Car</em>, which
        shares its title with the first short story in the book and is loosely based on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        It has been a while since I watched a movie in one go by myself. I just can’t
        relax enough to completely focus on the movie. There are multiple things going
        on in my head, questions that feel like they need instant answering.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are so many classic movies that I want to watch, but I am unable to make
        the space for them. It is easier for me to watch a movie when I am with someone,
        which I think is partly because I watched so many great movies growing up with
        my brother, and then at university with my ex.
      </p>

      <p>
        I haven’t even read anything since I came back after the break. I keep dismissing
        the idea, telling myself that I don’t have the energy, or that I am not in the mood.
        I don’t know why, but sitting quietly and doing something is almost scary to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even the studying I have done since coming back has been through lectures or
        ChatGPT, giving me a false sense of companionship. I keep unlocking my phone
        and switching between the same few apps, hoping for a new update of some sort.
      </p>

      <p>
        I keep doing chess puzzles on my phone, trying to use my brain in the most
        pressure-less way I can think of.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t understand when things became so heavy. I am definitely doing better
        than I did a couple of months ago, but somewhere along the way it seems that I
        have lost the energy and drive I remember having during my undergrad, even
        during the beginning of my master’s.
      </p>

      <p>
        Part of me likes to think that I am worth nothing by myself, that I need someone
        to prop me up and make me do my best work. And maybe there is some truth to that.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I also realize that the only one I can truly rely on, long term, is myself.
        So I need to do something. Maybe I just need more time. Maybe things will get
        better.
